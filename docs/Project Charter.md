| Topic | Specification |
| ----- | ------------- |
| **Start Date:** | 01/10/2019 |
| **End Date:** | December 2019 |
| **Project Manager:** | Diego Salzani |
| **Project Sponsor:** | ITI G.Marconi |
| **Customer:** | Everybody |
| **Users:** | Salzani Diego, Chafiki Nabil, Corrizzato Leonardo |
| **Stakeholders and Expectations:** | Team: Have immediate access to the necessary information about the weather, working hours or school hours and the main news of the dayProfessor Drago and Professor Bileddo: Have projects that can be submitted for the maturity examination and that can be used to solve common problems |
| **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project):** | The purpose of our project is to create a mirror capable of providing have immediate access to the necessary information about the weather, working hours or school hours and the main news of the day. |
| **Goals and Objectives:** | The general goal of the project is to give access to the news of the day that have happened in the world, ensure the weather in real time and view working hours or school hours whenever any person is reflected in the mirror |

## The app is expected to: 

* Have the weather in real time
* Have daily school or working hours
* Be constantly updated on the news of the day
* Have the time and date of the moment when you look at the mirror

## Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information) 
1 mirror €100 Raspberry Pi provided by the school1 LCD screen free1 wooden frame built us €100 total |
## Project Priorities and degrees of freedom  
The deadlines set with the professor are very tight, to be respected and deliver a first version by December.Roles are changeable based on workloads of individual team members.  Roles are expected to shift throughout the project as needs arise.
## Constraints  
The use of our smart mirror is constrained by the fact that to interact with the program you have to interface with mouse and keyboard, not having the possibility to use the touch. The funds provided by the school have been limited. 
## Assumptions  
Our Smart mirror works if it has an internet connection because it use APIs and links to databases.
## Success Criteria 
The project will be considered a success if  the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of December with the features mentioned in the goal section above, and two or more of the team members would be willing to work together on another software project in the future for developing a new features. 
## Scope  
At the minimum, the software will allow users to check their school hours of the day and be able to monitor the daily weather, and see a number of today&#39;s news.  Time permitting, functionality can be extended as needed. 
## Risks and obstacles to success  
A risk that the team has to face is the lack of experience in developing graphic libraries that can interface with the user and the lack of very limited time for the work required.  
This lack of experience generates many unknowns.
