#### 1 Overview

##### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This project was born under the necessity to create an IOT object that could be
implemented in every house and could give useful information to the owner.

##### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

The main goal was to deliver a finished version of the product before the ending of
2019, otherwise due to complications we had to postpone the release to January
2020.

Main Objectives of the project were to be able to give to the customer updated
information on weather, school schedule and time zones.

##### 1.3 Project Deliverables

The finished product will include:

- A smart mirror including an LCD panel
- A micro-computer connected to the server and the LCD that gives the
    informations
- A wood frame to hold the mirror
- And a user manual

##### 1.4 Assumptions and Constraints

Assummptions:

- The location API works on the test hardware
- An internet connection is needed
- Power supply is needed
Constraint:
- The software only works on linux
- For any software modification you will need to enter the OS

##### 1.5 Schedule and Budget Summary

The project didn’t had a precise budget thanks to the economical support of the
school.
Main costs were the mirror, the Raspberry PI, the frame and the LCD.

##### 1.6 Success Criteria

Success will be achived wen the mirror will be able to update itself from IP location
and the final product will be ready for delivery until the end of January.

#### 4 Supporting Process Plans

##### 4.1 Risk Management Plan

A risk that the team has to face is the lack of experience in developing graphic
libraries that can interface with the user and the lack of very limited time for the
work required. This lack of experience generates many unknowns.

##### 4.2 Configuration Management Plan

1. All work products will be stored in a repository running on Github
2. Only the system requirements, project plan and source code will be under
    configuration control.
3. Items that are subject to change control will be considered after a group
    review after they are created.
4. The change control procedure once a product is baselined is: anyone wanting
    to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the group
    describing the change, reason for the change, expected impact, and timeline
    for integrating the change. If no one responds to the group within 3 days with
    a reason for why the change request shouldn't be permitted, it will be
    considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with
    the change. If anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will
    be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their
    opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide
    whether or not the change should be allowed.
5. Including a change history with all documents is obligatory in all the
    documents. The change history should be at the front of the work item and
    include: the name of the person making the change, brief description of what
    has changed, reason for the change, and the date the change was integrated.

##### 4.3 Product Acceptance Plan

The project will be considered a success if the team delivers an operational
prototype necessary for the functions for which it was created and which reflects
the objectives documented by us, and two or more of the team members would be
willing to work together on another software project in the future for developing a
new features.
