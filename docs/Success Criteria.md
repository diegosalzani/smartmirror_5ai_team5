Success Criteria for Smart Mirror Project

The Smart Mirror project will be considered a success if . . .

**A fully functional test system is delivered on or before June 1st.**

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its
intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be
given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will
consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during
its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey.

**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem
resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan**

All critical defects found before June 1st will be fixed. A critical defect is
one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects,
requested changes will be based on the time required to solve that problem.
Changes taking 48 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks
before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 24 hours or less will be
done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project.
Changes taking 12 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week
before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy
prior to the start of the test program

**Community Youth can easily log into the system and customize according to
their tastes.**

This specifically means that a Youth will be able you can customize your access
options by consulting with the creators of the project, creating the membership
class and widgets needed for customization

**Developers can modify events and widgets within the project according to their
needs**

In particular, a developer, according to the user's needs, will be able to
insert a certain widget that solves one or more features. The developer will be
able to resolve and control any events within the project

**Developers can create and edit user accounts according to requests.**

All data should be editable from the Internet interface.

**Any databases in which the data will be contained will be constantly

The data concerning the database is entered each time and a backup database is
created.

**Developers can provide reports via Microsoft Excel to users who want to see
how the project is progressing.**

data properly displayed. The data on the report should accurately reflect that
which is in the database.

**The project is properly documented.**

First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user
manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic
Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all
features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of
the architecture document, for any developers who want to suggest changes or
